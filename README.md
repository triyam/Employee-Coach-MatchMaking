### **Key Features**

#### 1. **Data Simulation**  
- **Employee Attributes**:
  - Department  
  - Career Goals  
  - Emotional Support Needs  
  - Skill Development Areas  
  - Preferred Coaching Style  
  - Availability  
- **Coach Attributes**:
  - Certifications  
  - Specializations (Career, Emotional, Skill-Up)  
  - Coaching Style  
  - Experience Level  
  - Availability  
- Randomized dataset generation ensures flexibility and testing for a variety of input scenarios.

#### 2. **Compatibility Scoring**  
- A scoring system evaluates the alignment between employee needs and coach offerings.  
- Factors include goals, coaching style, skill alignment, and availability overlap.  
- Scores guide the prediction of optimal matches.

#### 3. **Deep Learning Model**  
- Built using **TensorFlow/Keras** to predict compatibility scores based on labeled data.  
- Incorporates embedding layers for categorical features like departments, career goals, and emotional needs.  
- Fully connected layers optimize the regression task to forecast match scores.

#### 4. **Data Visualization**  
- Includes **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for creating heatmaps, bar plots, and distribution charts.  
- Visual insights into coaching styles, career goals, and emotional support needs.  

#### 5. **Custom Predictions**  
- Input new employee details to predict their best-matched coaches.  
- Generates a sorted list of coaches based on compatibility scores.
